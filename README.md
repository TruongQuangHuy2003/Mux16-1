A 16:1 multiplexer (MUX) is a combinational digital circuit that select  one input out of 16 available inputs and routes it to a single output based on the binary value of 4 selection lines (S3, S2, S1, S0). Additionally, the inclusion of an enable (E) line provides a critical control mechanism to activate or deactivate the multiplexer. When the enable line is active (commonly logic 1), the MUX operates as expected, routing the selected input to the output, when the enable line is inactive (logic 0), the MUX output is disabled (typically held at logic 0 or high-impedance state, depending on implementation).
	The addition of the enable signal makes the 16:1 MUX more versatile , as it can be controlled externally to enable or disable functionality as required. This is especially useful in large-scale systems with multiplexers operating in parallel
